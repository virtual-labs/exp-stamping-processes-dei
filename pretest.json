      "question": "In a blanking operation, the piece removed is considered?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Scrap",
        "b": "The useful part",
        "c": "Waste material",
        "d": "None of the above"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. In blanking, the removed piece is the desired product.",
        "b": "Correct. In blanking, the removed piece (blank) is the useful product.",
        "c": "Incorrect. The removed piece is not waste in blanking; it is the final product.",
        "d": "Incorrect. One of the options is correct."

      "question": "The clearance in a shearing operation is the distance between?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Punch and Stripper",
        "b": "Punch cutting edge and Die cutting edge",
        "c": "Die and Stripper",
        "d": "Upper and Lower Die shoes"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The stripper removes material from the punch but does not define clearance.",
        "b": "Correct. Clearance is the gap between the punch cutting edge and die cutting edge.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Clearance is not defined between die and stripper.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Die shoes support the die assembly but do not determine clearance."

      "question": "Cutting force is directly proportional to?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Sheet Area",
        "b": "Sheet Thickness",
        "c": "Modulus of Elasticity",
        "d": "Poisson's Ratio"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Cutting force depends on perimeter, thickness, and shear strength — not total sheet area.",
        "b": "Correct. Cutting force is directly proportional to sheet thickness.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Modulus of elasticity affects elastic behavior, not directly the cutting force.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Poisson's ratio does not directly determine cutting force."

      "question": "Which stage comes first in the shearing process?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Fracture",
        "b": "Plastic Deformation",
        "c": "Penetration",
        "d": "Elastic Recovery"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Fracture occurs after crack propagation.",
        "b": "Correct. Plastic deformation is the first stage when the punch contacts the sheet.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Penetration occurs during deformation but plastic deformation begins first.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Elastic recovery happens after unloading."

    {
      "question": "Excessive clearance results in?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Cleaner cuts",
        "b": "Reduced force",
        "c": "Formation of burrs",
        "d": "Tool breakage"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Cleaner cuts occur at optimum clearance.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Although force may reduce slightly, it leads to poor edge quality.",
        "c": "Correct. Excessive clearance causes large burr formation and tapered edges.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Tool breakage is more commonly associated with insufficient clearance."
