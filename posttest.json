    {
      "question": "If material thickness increases, the required force:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Decreases",
        "b": "Increases",
        "c": "Remains same"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Cutting force is directly proportional to sheet thickness.",
        "b": "Correct. As thickness increases, the cutting force increases proportionally.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Force does not remain constant when thickness changes."
      },

    {
      "question": "What happens if clearance is too small?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Excessive burr",
        "b": "Secondary shear / higher force",
        "c": "Punch breaks immediately"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Excessive burr is usually caused by too large clearance.",
        "b": "Correct. Small clearance causes secondary shear and increases cutting force.",
        "c": "Incorrect. While tool wear may increase, immediate punch breakage is unlikely."
      },

    {
      "question": "Energy consumed is represented by area under:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Stress-Strain Curve",
        "b": "Force-Displacement Curve",
        "c": "Load-Time Curve"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Stress-strain curve represents material properties, not cutting energy directly.",
        "b": "Correct. The energy consumed in stamping is the area under the force-displacement curve.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Load-time curve does not represent mechanical work directly."

    {
      "question": "Which material generally requires higher force for same thickness?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Aluminum",
        "b": "Mild Steel",
        "c": "Lead"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Aluminum has lower shear strength than mild steel.",
        "b": "Correct. Mild steel has higher shear strength and requires greater cutting force.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Lead is very soft and requires much lower force."
      },

    {
      "question": "Optimal clearance for soft materials is generally:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Lower than hard materials",
        "b": "Higher than hard materials",
        "c": "Same as hard materials"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. Soft materials require smaller clearance compared to harder materials.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Hard materials generally require larger clearance.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Clearance depends on material properties."
