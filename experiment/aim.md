Aim
To understand the mechanics of the metal stamping process, specifically focusing on blanking and piercing operations. This experiment aims to demonstrate the relationship between punch force, material properties (shear strength, thickness), and die clearance. Students will analyze the force-displacement characteristics and identify the energy requirements for different materials.
